Hello, my name is Mark and I work @[BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/) as a Staff Software Engineer.

I'm also a published author with Apress and LeanPub:

### Apress

- [Quick Clojure: Effective Functional Programming](http://www.apress.com/9781484229514)
- [Pro Vim](http://www.apress.com/9781484202517)
- [Tmux Taster](http://www.apress.com/gb/book/9781484207765)

### LeanPub

- [Python for Programmers](https://leanpub.com/pythonforprogrammers)
- [Programming in Clojure](https://leanpub.com/programming-clojure/)

> **Status Update**: I'm currently working on a new book called 'Python 101' which will replace 'Python for Programmers'.
