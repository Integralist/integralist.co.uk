<h1 id="project-management-in-five-minutes">Project Management in Five Minutes</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a technical lead (aka engineering lead, lead developer, etc), then there comes a time where you&rsquo;ll be put in charge of a project.</p>

<p>You may also already be quite familiar with the process (read: red tape) of certain types of project management: agile, scrum, lean etc.</p>

<p>So what do you do, follow one of those methodologies to the letter and have to suffer all the process that comes along with it? You could do.</p>

<p>For me, I find the following things are good enough to get you by without having to worry about whether you&rsquo;re &ldquo;doing scrum&rdquo; (or whatever) correctly.</p>

<p>I suggest you take what you want and leave the rest.</p>

<p>But first, let&rsquo;s take a moment to recognise and understand a few distinct roles that otherwise can appear to have a lot of cross-over responsibilities (this has been summarised from the great work originally published by <a href="https://medium.com/@lara.hogan" target="_blank">Lara Hogan</a> - I highly recommend you check out her work).</p>

<h2 id="what-who-how-why">What Who How Why?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product Manager</strong>: owns the story of &ldquo;what&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Engineering Manager</strong>: owns the story of &ldquo;who&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Engineering Lead (Tech Lead)</strong>: owns the story of &ldquo;how&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>All Three</strong>: each person shares ownership of the story of &ldquo;why&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-management-checklist">Project Management Checklist</h2>

<p>This is a short checklist of things you probably should be doing&hellip;</p>

<p>ü§î Understand the requirements, and specifically why they are important.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t understand the project values, then you&rsquo;ll have a hard time building something that benefits your users.</li>
<li>Does the project even <em>align</em> with your team&rsquo;s mission statement/responsibilities? You should be focused on building things that bring value to your stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p>üìù Create simple/high-level Gherkin <a href="#user-stories">user stories</a></p>

<ul>
<li>This is one way of helping you better understand the product values and standards (there are other ways, but this is what I like using).</li>
</ul>

<p>‚úÖ Break down the requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>Define milestones and manageable sub tasks.</li>
<li>inc. investigation time, QA (Quality Assurance) and security testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>üîù Prioritise tasks</p>

<ul>
<li>You can do this either by &lsquo;importance/impact&rsquo; (High, Medium, Low) or using &lsquo;MSC&rsquo; (Must Should Could).</li>
<li>Once categorized, group related items (e.g. group together all high, medium, low items).</li>
<li>A table matrix can help visualise the various tasks and their importance.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the approach you choose, you wont be able to prioritize using just a &lsquo;problem/solution/impact&rsquo; approach. You&rsquo;ll need to document and consider both &lsquo;cost&rsquo; and &lsquo;risk&rsquo; as part of your assessment. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qd5wrcTLuwQFIUvHgpvYUC889tk1XLnFsRRbkjvTYpU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is an example document</a> you can use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>üóí Work through the unknowns</p>

<ul>
<li>Do this over and over, until there is no more value to be gained in spending time on them.</li>
</ul>

<p>üó£ Figure out who and which teams need to be consulted</p>

<ul>
<li>Then communicate as often as practical and/or relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>üìÜ Run the project and adjust the plan as you go.</p>

<ul>
<li>How far has the project come?</li>
<li>How far is it from completion?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t work <em>faster</em> (and or <em>harder</em>) when you discover the team is missing deadlines (e.g. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ok, I know we missed this deadline/milestone, but we&rsquo;re <em>sooooo</em> close, let&rsquo;s crank it up and get it done!&rdquo;). <strong>STOP!</strong> take a breath and understand why the deadline was missed. Were there any trending patterns that are likely to repeat themselves?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>üìà Track changes to requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>Be clear about the cost of those changes.</li>
<li>How do these changes affect the completion?</li>
<li>Should we cut some existing features in order to accommodate the new work?</li>
</ul>

<p>üìä Ensure observability and monitoring is in place.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never release a product you can&rsquo;t track out in the wild.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget your on-call process. Ensure monitors are in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>‚õë Define a rollout plan and what the roll back steps look like.</p>

<ul>
<li>What systems need to be integrated with?</li>
<li>Notify appropriate on-call and support teams.</li>
<li>Rollback plan can be a spreadsheet, word doc, doesn&rsquo;t matter, just have one.</li>
</ul>

<p>‚ù§Ô∏è Retro</p>

<ul>
<li>What went well, what didn&rsquo;t, what could we do differently in future?</li>
<li>Communicate with radical candor (care personally, challenge directly).</li>
</ul>

<p>üéâ CELEBRATE!</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t matter how big or small the project, or whether it was difficult at times. Always, always, celebrate the finishing line and thank your team for their hard work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shielding">Shielding</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t shield the team from issues that are arising around them (e.g. don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;oh, they&rsquo;re stressed and missing deadlines, so I need to pretend like everything is ok&rdquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s not ok). Treat the team with respect, as adults, and let them know things aren&rsquo;t working and that we need to adjust the process to resolve that.</p>

<p>Yes, shield the team from <em>distractions</em>, but that is something altogether different than shielding them from bombs exploding around them. They can help you negotiate those mindfields if you let them. We&rsquo;re working with adults, and they don&rsquo;t need to have scary things hidden from them.</p>

<h2 id="positive-mindset">Positive Mindset</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that swapping the word &ldquo;problem&rdquo; for &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; a good thing to do in general, whether it be talking about an actual technical challenge or discussing a challenging interaction with another employee.</p>

<p>The subtle switch in language helps me refocus on a more positive and motivated projectory (rather than setting myself up to be in a negative mindset for the conversation).</p>

<h2 id="recognising-trends">Recognising Trends</h2>

<p>As time goes on, you might start having issues with your team (for various reasons - we&rsquo;re humans, we&rsquo;re notoriously difficult creatures).</p>

<p>When reporting to your line manager (e.g. 1:1&rsquo;s where you discuss things that are on your mind), it can be difficult sometimes to voice concerns without explicit examples.</p>

<p>Depending on the situation, explicit examples aren&rsquo;t always possible to recall. In those cases where you have a niggling feeling something isn&rsquo;t quite right but you couldn&rsquo;t point to an exact moment in time where an incident occurred, then being able to see a <em>trend</em> of something negative happening can help you to raise it up to leadership.</p>

<p>Be aware of trends in people, otherwise you might find yourself in a bad situation and not sure how or why you got there in the first place. If you catch problems early enough, you can help work towards a solution that gets your team back on track.</p>

<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re not familiar with user stories&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gherkin is plain-text with a little extra structure and is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains. &ndash; <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/reference" target="_blank">https://cucumber.io/docs/reference</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it&rsquo;s good for documentation, but it can also be helpful to some teams to use these user stories as a foundation for their own integration testing systems (although I personally wouldn&rsquo;t, I prefer just using them as a simple reference for what it is we want to achieve at a high-level).</p>

<p>Below is an example &lsquo;feature&rsquo;, broken down into various scenarios.</p>

<pre><code>Feature: User Authentication
  
  ...optional description about this feature here...

Scenario: authenticated user requesting a page
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)

Scenario: unauthenticated user requesting a page
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I‚Äôm not signed in
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com or www.buzzfeed.com/post
  Then I am able to login with &lt;method&gt;

  Examples:
    | method            |
    | Facebook          |
    | Twitter           |
    | Google            |
    | Username/Password |

Scenario: unauthenticated user successful login
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I provide valid credentials
  When I attempt to login
  Then I am directed to my destination page

Scenario: unauthenticated user failed login
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I provide invalid credentials
  When I attempt to login
  Then I am presented with a login error

Scenario: unauthenticated user sign-up
  Given I am a BuzzFeed user (internal or external)
  And I am not already registered in the system
  When I visit www.buzzfeed.com/cms
  Then I am directed to a legacy sign-up flow
