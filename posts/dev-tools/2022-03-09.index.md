# Developer Tools

I don't know who needs to hear this but:\
**I love my developer tools**.

## Core

- **Package Manager**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- **Terminal**: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)
- **Code Editor**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io)

## History

- Used stock macOS Terminal.app with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
  for 10+ years.
- I tried [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/),
  [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/),
  [WesTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) but none really fit well for me.
- Constant colour issues forced me to switch from tmux to
  [Zellij](https://zellij.dev).
- I moved to using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) for a few years, but it still
  had issues.
- I finally landed on [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) which has been great. Yes,
  it still has minor issues but the community is active and open.

## Workflow

I use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) Autocomplete with
[fzf-tab](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab) to replace Zsh's default completion
selection menu with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) which works really
nicely.

I mostly use terminal splits and tabs for dividing up projects and tasks, and on
the occasion I'll use Neovim's built-in terminal across multiple splits or
floating windows. Otherwise, the other part of Ghostty I use _a lot_ is its
floating terminal that can be triggered from anywhere via a hotkey (as long as
Ghostty is open somewhere).

## Browser

Controversial, but I had moved away from
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) with a whole suite of
security/privacy minded tools to [Apple's
Safari](https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/) browser.

I _was_ using Safari's ["Tab
Group"](https://twitter.com/integralist/status/1514526555275501569?s=20&t=BJu3WlWq6dhoeAarJf91ig)
feature, which I _really_ liked along with the following extensions...

- AdBlock One
- Dark Reader for Safari
- SimplyJSON for Safari
- Super Agent for Safari (Cookie Consent Automation)

...but ultimately the Tab Groups feature ended up being super buggy and
duplicating bookmarks and groups etc and I couldn't get the issue resolved, so I
ended up back with Google Chrome.

> ðŸ’¡ In the future I'll likely switch over to using
> [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org/).
