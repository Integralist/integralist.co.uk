# integralist.co.uk

Website built using [Go](https://golang.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## New Post

- `hugo new ./posts/<name-of-post>.md`

- `vim **<Tab>`(search for `/content/posts/...` using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for file searching)

- `hugo server` (for previewing)

## Site Search

The search capabilities are provided by [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).

The index document `/static/js/lunr/index.json` is generated by `npm run index`.

The best thing to do is to just execute `npm run dev` instead of `hugo server` as this will ensure the lunr index is rebuilt accordingly.

The dependencies are jQuery and lunr.js on the client-side, the following for the build time compilation:

```bash
npm install --save-dev grunt string js-yaml
```
