<p>Hello, my name is Mark and I work at <a href="https://www.fastly.com/" target="_blank">Fastly</a> as a Staff Software Engineer.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/profile-2024.jpg" class="image fit half border">

<h2 id="working-together-testimonials">Working Together / Testimonials</h2>

<p>The following quotes are all <strong>genuine</strong>. I&rsquo;ve never asked anyone I&rsquo;ve worked
with to say/write something nice about me, but I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune to have
built up wonderful relationships with the people I work with, and so they have
responded in kind by posting nice things to/about me in public work Slack
channels&hellip;</p>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Product Support at BuzzFeed</summary>
	<p><i>"As smart as developers are, they are not always good at explaining things in a way that makes human sense. not you. you are an exception. you are A+"</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Product Support at BuzzFeed.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I ‚ù§Ô∏è this feedback. It came from someone I was mentoring. She was interested in getting a better understanding of how to design and architect software systems, and also how to know what types of questions she should ask when investigating technical incidents.</p>
	<p class="review">Her feedback also hints at something bigger which I strive for: to help others to do their best work and to push/promote the good work other engineers do (including those from either a diverse background or minority).</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Engineering Manager at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>"Hi Mark, your name keeps coming up (in a good way üòâ) and I wanted to put a face to a name. Folks on the team like working with you. You're responsive and provide good and timely feedback."</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Engineering Manager at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I always aim to build meaningful relationships with the people I work with across an organisation. In doing so I hope to ensure that we are able to work as a cohesive unit, and provide great value to our users. But ultimately I like to be helpful (it makes me feel good), so this was a nice bit of unexpected feedback ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>"Thanks, I'm amazed that you always deliver top notch answers."</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">Funnily enough I actually _didn't_ have the answer they needed. I wanted to redirect this person to where I thought would be the best place for them to get a solution (so it included as much historical context, and as many signposts, as I could provide).</p>
	<p class="review">A kind smile, a compassionate ear, and a bit of effort goes a long way in life.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>"Hey Man‚Ä¶ you are a true powerhouse in fixing issues and handling customers‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm truly impressed by you! Thanks and keep it up!"</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I work hard to ensure customers get the support they need. This feedback was the result of another example of my work ethic.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Solutions Architect at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Hey Mark, thanks again for releasing the 4.0.0 version, last week! The customer already provided positive feedback. It's a pleasure to work in such a smooth way! üôá</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Solutions Architect at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">In this case my colleague was unfamiliar with writing Go and he was trying to contribute to a couple of different code bases that I was the core maintainer of, and for which I was helping guide him through and supporting/educating him on the various technical aspects of. It was a small change but one I really appreciated him taking the time to dig in and help implement.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Customer + CSE (Customer Support Engineer) at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Thank you for your output and all the information you've provided. We really appreciate it. We have applied your latest release on all our production environments and it's looking great and there are no unexpected diffs in our Terraform plans anymore. Again, thank you for your time and your help to understand and resolve this issue as your insights were really helpful.</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Customer</small></p>
	<p><i>Hey Mark, just wanted to say thanks a lot for helping out with the Terraform issue, really appreciated! üôÇ</i></p>
	<p><small>-- CSE (Customer Support Engineer) at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">We had a strange bug materialize in the Fastly Terraform provider that was causing some issues for customers. I investigated on behalf of CSE as I'm the core SME (Subject Matter Expert) for Terraform and I not only resolved the specific issue but managed to identify a couple of other unnoticed bugs elsewhere in the system which I worked cross-team to help get resolved.</p>
	<p class="review">It was important to me that this customer (like all our customers) got their issues resolved as quickly as possible, with frequent updates to keep them in the loop and extra detailed explanations so they were better informed. It was a tough set of bugs to identify but I was pleased for the customer when they confirmed their services were all good again.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Director of Community at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I want to call out this great thread in the fastly dev forum and give a huge bravo to @integralist for being there, being responsive, and guiding the customer to the solution. Overall the thread is <code>:chefkiss:</code> because...</i></p>
	<p><i>- It makes for a great image optimization use case/support-driven tutorial.</i></br>
	<i>- Is a display of how engaged our dev rel team is with the Community.</i></br>
	<i>- Is a display of how smart and kind our users are.</i></br>
	<i>- Uses the Fastly platform tools (like <a href="https://fiddle.fastly.dev/" target="_blank">https://fiddle.fastly.dev/</a>) to show our work!</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Director of Community at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">This was a really nice (and unexpected) compliment. I like to go the extra mile to ensure customers feel seen/heard and that they're supported (even if it means I can't give them an immediate answer and need to refer to another team's expertise first).</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Developer Relations Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I just wanted to say that the care and attention you're putting into this work is making me enjoy my work, and I appreciate you.</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Developer Relations Engineer at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">I was touched by this feedback as I had been battling a particularly difficult project and this came at a time where I was emotionally and mentally exhausted. Just the pickup I needed üíñ</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Tier 3 Customer Support Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I want to thank @integralist for always answering any questions I (or others) have with so much detail and attention. Your answers usually long and full of thought and for that I am extremely grateful!</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Tier 3 Customer Support Engineer at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">This was posted in a Fastly #gratitude Slack channel and got lots of nice emoji reactions to go with it üíñ</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Customer Support Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Thank you so much Mark for going above and beyond. I appreciate the details you provided.</i></p>
	<p><code>later the next day...</code></p>
	<p><i>Wow, this is amazing work Mark! Thank you so much for this thorough analysis.</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Customer Support Engineer at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">A customer had reported an issue that we initially were not able to replicate. But after some thorough debugging (through _multiple_ internal systems) I was able to identify, explain, and document the source of the problem, then provide a resolution for the customer.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Security Architect at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Man, it‚Äôs nice working with you</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Security Architect at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">This certainly came out of nowhere üôÇ. He needed a bunch of information related to some security work I was doing (I was <a href="https://github.com/fastly/cli/pull/1010" target="_blank">implementing SSO Single Sign-On using an OAuth PKCE flow for Fastly's CLI tool</a>) so I gave it to him whilst also pointing out some oddities about the platform that I felt should be addressed.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Principal Sales Engineer / TLS Manager / Sr. Principal Engineer, Core Systems at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I wanted to share feedback from <code>NAME_OF_LARGE_CUSTOMER_IM_NOT_ALLOWED_TO_SHARE</code> to give you positive feedback on our Terraform provider vs <code>COMPETITOR</code>'s:</i></p>
	<p><i>"The team were quite shocked at the difference between <code>COMPETITOR</code>'s Terraform approach and Fastly....Fastly was a lot simpler, and just as powerful. Express my gratitude to the team for making the Terraform provider so awesome!"</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Principal Sales Engineer at Fastly</small></p>
	<p><i>It‚Äôs all @Integralist üòÖ</i></p>
	<p><small>-- TLS Manager at Fastly</small></p>

	<p><small>-- Sr. Principal Engineer, Core Systems</small></p>
	<p><i>Piling on here with <code>ANOTHER_LARGE_CUSTOMER</code> giving kudos to the TF provider. üôÇ</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Cloud Engineering Manager</small></p>
	<p class="review">I'm very grateful for this feedback, both from the customer and from my colleagues as I had been working really hard on improving the Terraform provider and up until that point hadn't felt that any one had noticed or cared, and so this helped boost my confidence in what I had been doing. üíõ</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Cloud Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>This level of investigation deserves a medal @integralist. Thank you so much for your time and deduction!</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Cloud Engineer at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">A question was raised, which wasn't relevant to the channel it was brought up in but I didn't want this person to go away without the appropriate support. So as well as redirecting them to the correct channel and explaining why I was redirecting them, I then proceeded to explain the steps/processes I follow when trying to figure out the thing they were asking about. This led to a long thread of details and links to code and documentation. As much as I could provide as a helpful send off.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Staff Product Manager at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Your code review is itself a work of art! Is there a hall of fame for code reviews.</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Staff Product Manager at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I take a lot of care in my PR reviews üòä.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Director of Developer Experience at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Look‚Ä¶ that was f***ing impressive. üëè</i><br>Thank you so much!</p>
	<p><small>-- Director of Developer Experience at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">A customer was having issues with one of our tools when using Windows. Fastly pulled out all the stops to get me the access I needed to investigate and debug the issue properly and I was able to get a fix in place in a few hours, helping the customer realise what an asset Fastly is to their workflow.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Principal Engineer in Edge Networking at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>You demonstrate, year in and year out, an excellent capacity to learn new systems and languages, pick up the responsibility of managing and being responsible for parts of our stack and technology and it looks like you work smoothly and effortlessly with our colleagues both in person / zoom and in slack / Jira / pull requests.  Thank you also for your regular, consistent contributions and easy-going working demeanor.  This is the sort of collegial professionalism and competence that makes Fastly a great place to work.</i></p>
	<p><small>Principal Engineer in Edge Networking at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">This particular person was leaving Fastly (to retire) and I reached out to wish them all the best and to let them know what an honour it had been for me to get just a small bit of experience working with them. This was their response to me, totally unexpected last piece of kindness shared by this wonderful individual.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Staff Product Manager in Network Services at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I'm sharing a Very, Very Big Shout-Out to @integralist for his work on the Eng side of the Domainr + Fastly systems integration efforts!</i></p>

	<p><i>Thank you, Mark!</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Staff Product Manager in Network Services at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p><i>I also want to add that @integralist has done an amazing job on both documentation and tooling improvements for on-call.</i></p>
	<p><i>As a member of the domain services team that is now responsible for handling on call and being onboarded to domainr codebase and systems, it has been a huge help in orienting myself.</i></p>

	<p class="review">I created a design document for how to improve the

	much back and forth discussion I went ahead and started to implement a POC

	<summary>Senior Manager, Technical Documentation | Product Growth at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I wanted to take a moment to recognize Mark's recent help with a GitHub workflow implementation. I've been trying to teach myself some things about more complex GitHub interactions and this was on my list of goals for Q1 2025. Mark took the time to test an approach in his private repository to ensure things would work. What really made the difference was how he helped me understand how to adapt the workflow to my specific needs. His willingness to both gently mentor and troubleshoot, especially while busy and in an entirely different time zone than me made this successful. And he cheered me on to boot. I'm genuinely grateful for his support. This kind of collaborative knowledge-sharing makes our company stronger.</i></p>

	<p>I was a former customer of Fastly, and had become well known for publishing probably the longest known article on the subject of Varnish, VCL and Fastly's implementation.<p>
	<p>I joined Fastly to work within its new (at the time) Developer Relations team helping to manage, support and be the core developer for their suite of API clients (inc. orchestration tools such as Terraform and Fastly's own <a href="https://github.com/fastly/terraform-provider-fastly" target="_blank">Terraform provider</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/fastly/cli" target="_blank">Fastly CLI</a>).<p>
	<p>While working within the Developer Relations team I had the opportunity to work on critical Rust projects such as https://fiddle.fastly.dev and to work cross-team to develop a new authentication model for customer services.<p>
	<p>In 2023 it became apparent that the tools I was responsible for maintaining were becoming even more important for our customers and so I was able to move from DevRel into my own dedicated team (Customer Developer Tools) to continue to support them without having to also support the various DevRel related projects and services.<p>
	<p>In 2024, I was brought into a new team (a team of one for about a year) called "Domain Services" to
		help onboard and integrate a new API Fastly had acquired. This required
	a significant amount of time and effort as (up until this point) I had only
	worked on open-source projects at Fastly and this was my first exposure to
		the internal systems and deployment platform and pipelines.<p>

	<p>I joined as a Senior Software Engineer as part of a new 'core' UK dev team. We were responsible for decommissioning a 10yr+ legacy Perl monolithic application stack over to individual Python and Go services.<p>
	<p>I was working primarily within BuzzFeed's OO-INFRA group, which sits somewhere in-between traditional infrastructure/operation teams and engineering teams building user facing products. Our motivations were to make the lives of our fellow engineers easier by building tools, services and abstractions that enabled them to work more quickly and efficiently.<p>
	<p>January 2018 BuzzFeed promoted me to Staff Software Engineer, after helping to design/architect, develop and maintain some of BuzzFeed's key infrastructure and software (CDN, caching strategies, routing behaviours, and security/authentication related concerns).<p>
	<p>January 2019 I moved over to the Core Infrastructure team (which consists of separate sub teams). I was part of the 'Infra Edge' team, and we were responsible for strengthening and securing our edge infrastructure and applications. The 'edge' is the surface area of our infrastructure that is in direct contact with the public internet. It includes DNS and the various services that accept ingress traffic from the Big Bad Internet. It is essential to our business that our Edge be a resilient and security-focused layer of our infrastructure.<p>
	<p>Each year I participated in different working groups and mentoring programs, and became part of the 'on-call' rota, and handled interactions with the Hackerone program.<p>

Within the year I had moved into a senior engineering role. The (then) Technical Lead for the BBC News Frameworks team requested I join them in order to help the organisation transition from its current platform over to one built upon the AWS platform.<p>
	<p>I started in the Frameworks team building and designing back-end architecture for different microservices hosted upon the AWS platform, and we developed these services primarily using JRuby. In October 2014, I was offered the role of Technical Lead.<p>
	<p>Near the end of 2015 I decided to change roles to Principal Software Engineer, as my previous role involved more meetings and handling line manager duties, whereas I wanted to focus my time more on helping my team solve technical problems.<p>

<strong>Impact</strong>: A better designed and more stable Terraform integration for TLS services, leading to an improved customer experience.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What</strong>: Redesigned internal boilerplate project used for creating new
Go services at Fastly.<br>
<strong>Why</strong>: As part of my work within a new team (although I was the sole
engineer for quite a while) I needed to get a new API application onboarded
with an internal platform that exposes the API to the public internet. The
recommendation was to use an internal boilerplate project, which turned out to
be quite stale, un-maintained, and in need of a redesign.<br>
<strong>Impact</strong>: Quite a few internal teams were onboarding onto the same
platform around that time and were able to benefit from not only the improved
tooling I built, the improved resiliency code I wrote, but also the in-depth
documentation I wrote to provide context and understanding around how the
platform itself functioned. Ultimately making it much easier for developers to
onboard their Go applications.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What</strong>: I created a public tool for validating Fastly&rsquo;s Compute cache semantics (<a href="https://gist.github.com/Integralist/87118a8f79d47aaf640c21149bf9d687" target="_blank">code</a>).<br>
<strong>Why</strong>: Customers were having trouble understanding how HTTP cache semantics worked with the Fastly Compute platform (which at the time of writing doesn&rsquo;t have a HTTP cache API like Fastly&rsquo;s VCL product offering).<br>
<strong>Impact</strong>: Customers are able to validate and understand how caching works with Compute. They can define a set of HTTP calls and see how they are cached, and can assert against the cacheability of the calls. This work also helped to identify a bug in the underlying HTTP caching implementation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What</strong>: I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, along with dynamic service creation for multiple environments using Terraform Cloud.<br>
<strong>Why</strong>: We wanted to move towards Iac (Infrastructure as Code) and automated releases.<br>
<strong>Impact</strong>: We&rsquo;re able to easily spin up environment specific instances of our service(s) and all the benefits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment" target="_blank">Continuous Deployment</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What</strong>: I moved into a new team working exclusively on <a href="https://domainr.com/" target="_blank">Domainr</a>.<br>
<strong>Why</strong>: It was felt my skill set would be ideal to help not only take over the project as the lead developer but to begin the planning, architecture and development on new features and products based around Domainr and its subject area.<br>
<strong>Impact</strong>: Too early to say. But one month in and I&rsquo;m very excited about the future.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What</strong>: Implemented a solution to enable public repo forks to have access to GitHub Actions secrets.<br>
<strong>Why</strong>: Fork PRs do not have access to GitHub Action secrets which makes validating the correctness of community contributed code much harder.<br>
<strong>Impact</strong>: An authorised user (i.e. a contributor with WRITE access to the repo) can now comment <code>/ok-to-test sha=&lt;SHA&gt;</code> and this will trigger the CI to run with the correct secret(s) access.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What</strong>: Built an interactive CLI prompt to generate OpenAPI schemas.<br>
<strong>Why</strong>: Two reasons: the first was that developers were unfamiliar with OpenAPI and unsure how to write the schemas (the learning curve wasn&rsquo;t steep but substantial for busy devs), and second: we use our schemas for auto-generating API clients and so it was easy for developers to design schemas that would break the code-generation process or produce invalid client code.<br>
<strong>Impact</strong>: Consistency in our OpenAPI schema design, which helped to improve the generated client code interface (so a much better developer experience) as well as reduced errors in the API clients overall.</p></li>

I have no time for open-source contributions.</p>
