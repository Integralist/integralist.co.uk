## Working Together / Testimonials

The following quotes are all **genuine**. I've never asked anyone I've worked
with to say/write something nice about me, but I've had the good fortune to have
built up wonderful relationships with the people I work with, and so they have
responded in kind by posting nice things to/about me in public work Slack
channels...

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Product Support at BuzzFeed</summary>
	<p><i>"As smart as developers are, they are not always good at explaining things in a way that makes human sense. not you. you are an exception. you are A+"</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Product Support at BuzzFeed.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I ‚ù§Ô∏è this feedback. It came from someone I was mentoring. She was interested in getting a better understanding of how to design and architect software systems, and also how to know what types of questions she should ask when investigating technical incidents.</p>
	<p class="review">Her feedback also hints at something bigger which I strive for: to help others to do their best work and to push/promote the good work other engineers do (including those from either a diverse background or minority).</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Engineering Manager at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>"Hi Mark, your name keeps coming up (in a good way üòâ) and I wanted to put a face to a name. Folks on the team like working with you. You're responsive and provide good and timely feedback."</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Engineering Manager at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I always aim to build meaningful relationships with the people I work with across an organisation. In doing so I hope to ensure that we are able to work as a cohesive unit, and provide great value to our users. But ultimately I like to be helpful (it makes me feel good), so this was a nice bit of unexpected feedback ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>"Thanks, I'm amazed that you always deliver top notch answers."</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">Funnily enough I actually _didn't_ have the answer they needed. I wanted to redirect this person to where I thought would be the best place for them to get a solution (so it included as much historical context, and as many signposts, as I could provide).</p>
	<p class="review">A kind smile, a compassionate ear, and a bit of effort goes a long way in life.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>"Hey Man‚Ä¶ you are a true powerhouse in fixing issues and handling customers‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm truly impressed by you! Thanks and keep it up!"</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Sales Engineer at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">I work hard to ensure customers get the support they need. This feedback was the result of another example of my work ethic.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Senior Solutions Architect at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Hey Mark, thanks again for releasing the 4.0.0 version, last week! The customer already provided positive feedback. It's a pleasure to work in such a smooth way! üôá</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Solutions Architect at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">In this case my colleague was unfamiliar with writing Go and he was trying to contribute to a couple of different code bases that I was the core maintainer of, and for which I was helping guide him through and supporting/educating him on the various technical aspects of. It was a small change but one I really appreciated him taking the time to dig in and help implement.</p>
</details>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Customer + CSE (Customer Support Engineer) at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Thank you for your output and all the information you've provided. We really appreciate it. We have applied your latest release on all our production environments and it's looking great and there are no unexpected diffs in our Terraform plans anymore. Again, thank you for your time and your help to understand and resolve this issue as your insights were really helpful.</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Customer</small></p>
	<p><i>Hey Mark, just wanted to say thanks a lot for helping out with the Terraform issue, really appreciated! üôÇ</i></p>
	<p><small>-- CSE (Customer Support Engineer) at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">We had a strange bug materialize in the Fastly Terraform provider that was causing some issues for customers. I investigated on behalf of CSE as I'm the core SME (Subject Matter Expert) for Terraform and I not only resolved the specific issue but managed to identify a couple of other unnoticed bugs elsewhere in the system which I worked cross-team to help get resolved.</p>
	<p class="review">It was important to me that this customer (like all our customers) got their issues resolved as quickly as possible, with frequent updates to keep them in the loop and extra detailed explanations so they were better informed. It was a tough set of bugs to identify but I was pleased for the customer when they confirmed their services were all good again.</p>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Director of Community at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>I want to call out this great thread in the fastly dev forum and give a huge bravo to @integralist for being there, being responsive, and guiding the customer to the solution. Overall the thread is <code>:chefkiss:</code> because...</i></p>
	<p><i>- It makes for a great image optimization use case/support-driven tutorial.</i></br>
	<i>- Is a display of how engaged our dev rel team is with the Community.</i></br>

	<i>- Uses the Fastly platform tools (like <a href="https://fiddle.fastly.dev/" target="_blank">https://fiddle.fastly.dev/</a>) to show our work!</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Director of Community at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">This was a really nice (and unexpected) compliment. I like to go the extra mile to ensure customers feel seen/heard and that they're supported (even if it means I can't give them an immediate answer and need to refer to another team's expertise first).</p>

	<p><i>Wow, this is amazing work Mark! Thank you so much for this thorough analysis.</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Senior Customer Support Engineer at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">A customer had reported an issue that we initially were not able to replicate. But after some thorough debugging (through _multiple_ internal systems) I was able to identify, explain, and document the source of the problem, then provide a resolution for the customer.</p>

<details class="testimonial">
	<summary>Security Architect at Fastly</summary>
	<p><i>Man, it‚Äôs nice working with you</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Security Architect at Fastly</small></p>
	<p class="review">This certainly came out of nowhere üôÇ. He needed a bunch of information related to some security work I was doing (I was <a href="https://github.com/fastly/cli/pull/1010" target="_blank">implementing SSO Single Sign-On using an OAuth PKCE flow for Fastly's CLI tool</a>) so I gave it to him whilst also pointing out some oddities about the platform that I felt should be addressed.</p>

	<p class="review">I'm very grateful for this feedback, both from the customer and from my colleagues as I had been working really hard on improving the Terraform provider and up until that point hadn't felt that any one had noticed or cared, and so this helped boost my confidence in what I had been doing. üíõ</p>

	<p><i>This level of investigation deserves a medal @integralist. Thank you so much for your time and deduction!</i></p>
	<p><small>-- Cloud Engineer at Fastly.</small></p>
	<p class="review">A question was raised, which wasn't relevant to the channel it was brought up in but I didn't want this person to go away without the appropriate support. So as well as redirecting them to the correct channel and explaining why I was redirecting them, I then proceeded to explain the steps/processes I follow when trying to figure out the thing they were asking about. This led to a long thread of details and links to code and documentation. As much as I could provide as a helpful send off.</p>

### Fastly (October 2020 - present)

<details>
 <summary>Details</summary>
	<p>I was a former customer of Fastly, and had become well known for publishing probably the longest known article on the subject of Varnish, VCL and Fastly's implementation.<p>
	<p>I joined Fastly to work within its new (at the time) Developer Relations team helping to manage, support and be the core developer for their suite of API clients (inc. orchestration tools such as Terraform and Fastly's own <a href="https://github.com/fastly/terraform-provider-fastly" target="_blank">Terraform provider</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/fastly/cli" target="_blank">Fastly CLI</a>).<p>
	<p>While working within the Developer Relations team I had the opportunity to work on critical Rust projects such as https://fiddle.fastly.dev and to work cross-team to develop a new authentication model for customer services.<p>
	<p>In 2023 it became apparent that the tools I was responsible for maintaining were becoming even more important for our customers and so I was able to move from DevRel into my own dedicated team (Customer Developer Tools) to continue to support them without having to also support the various DevRel related projects and services.<p>
	<p>In 2024, I was brought into a new team (a team of one for about a year) called "Domain Services" to
		help onboard and integrate a new API Fastly had acquired. This required
	a significant amount of time and effort as (up until this point) I had only
	worked on open-source projects at Fastly and this was my first exposure to
		the internal systems and deployment platform and pipelines.<p>
</details>

### BuzzFeed (June 2016 - October 2020)

<details>
 <summary>Details</summary>
	<p>I joined as a Senior Software Engineer as part of a new 'core' UK dev team. We were responsible for decommissioning a 10yr+ legacy Perl monolithic application stack over to individual Python and Go services.<p>
	<p>I was working primarily within BuzzFeed's OO-INFRA group, which sits somewhere in-between traditional infrastructure/operation teams and engineering teams building user facing products. Our motivations were to make the lives of our fellow engineers easier by building tools, services and abstractions that enabled them to work more quickly and efficiently.<p>
	<p>January 2018 BuzzFeed promoted me to Staff Software Engineer, after helping to design/architect, develop and maintain some of BuzzFeed's key infrastructure and software (CDN, caching strategies, routing behaviours, and security/authentication related concerns).<p>
	<p>January 2019 I moved over to the Core Infrastructure team (which consists of separate sub teams). I was part of the 'Infra Edge' team, and we were responsible for strengthening and securing our edge infrastructure and applications. The 'edge' is the surface area of our infrastructure that is in direct contact with the public internet. It includes DNS and the various services that accept ingress traffic from the Big Bad Internet. It is essential to our business that our Edge be a resilient and security-focused layer of our infrastructure.<p>
	<p>Each year I participated in different working groups and mentoring programs, and became part of the 'on-call' rota, and handled interactions with the Hackerone program.<p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>‚ö†Ô∏è  <b>NOTE</b><br>I'm a remote worker and my team resides primarily in New York, so good communication, focus and work ethic was essential.</p>

### BBC (Jan 2013 - June 2016)

<details>
 <summary>Details</summary>
	<p>I joined <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news" target="_blank">BBC News</a> as a client-side/mobile specialist within their Core News team. Within the year I had moved into a senior engineering role. The (then) Technical Lead for the BBC News Frameworks team requested I join them in order to help the organisation transition from its current platform over to one built upon the AWS platform.<p>
	<p>I started in the Frameworks team building and designing back-end architecture for different microservices hosted upon the AWS platform, and we developed these services primarily using JRuby. In October 2014, I was offered the role of Technical Lead.<p>
	<p>Near the end of 2015 I decided to change roles to Principal Software Engineer, as my previous role involved more meetings and handling line manager duties, whereas I wanted to focus my time more on helping my team solve technical problems.<p>
</details>

### Storm Creative (Feb 2001 - Dec 2012)

<details>
 <summary>Details</summary>
	<p>I started working at the agency <a href="http://www.stormcreative.co.uk/" target="_blank">Storm Creative</a> straight out of college. I was always focused on learning and improving my skill set - both technical and communication skills - the latter helped me communicate better with both clients and other stakeholders/colleagues.<p>
	<p>I progressed upwards through the organisation, moving from initially being a client-side web developer (this included doing animations utilising ActionScript 3.0) to becoming a server-side developer (ASP.NET, PHP and Ruby), then onto becoming a Technical Lead across all projects and finally becoming the Digital Media Manager responsible for my own team of four engineers and overseeing all aspects of our projects.<p>

### üè¢ Fastly

### 2025

- **What**: Took on a lead engineering role for "Blue Ribbon", a major project to enable path-based routing for customers via the API.\
  **Why**: My experience in API design and leading complex projects made me a good fit to drive this high-priority initiative forward.\
  **Impact**: I quickly got up to speed on a new and complex domain, authored the core API design document, and began leading the technical implementation. This project will deliver a highly-requested feature, allowing customers to manage complex routing rules without writing custom code.

- **What**: Collaborated with another team to create architectural diagrams for the Managed DNS project.\
  **Why**: To ensure a shared understanding and alignment on a complex, cross-team initiative.\
  **Impact**: The collaborative effort resulted in clear and accurate diagrams that became the source of truth for the project's architecture, improving communication and reducing misunderstandings between teams.

- **What**: Created the official on-call process and documentation for the Domain Services team.\
  **Why**: A clear and well-defined on-call process is essential for ensuring service reliability and maintaining a healthy work-life balance for the team.\
  **Impact**: The document established clear expectations and procedures for the on-call rotation, leading to more effective incident response and a more sustainable on-call experience for engineers.

- **What**: Played a key role in triaging and resolving a major Terraform issue related to a legacy product deprecation.\
  **Why**: The issue was impacting a large number of customers and required deep expertise in both Terraform and Fastly's platform to resolve.\
  **Impact**: My involvement helped to quickly identify the root cause and guide customers towards a solution, minimizing the impact of the deprecation and demonstrating our commitment to customer support.

- **What**: Integrated a new certificate authority into the Ascerta platform.\
  **Why**: To provide more options and redundancy for certificate issuance.\
  **Impact**: This integration increased the flexibility and resilience of our certificate issuance pipeline, giving us more choices and mitigating risks associated with relying on a single authority.

- **What**: Implemented and configured the core messaging infrastructure (NSQ) for the Ascerta service.\
  **Why**: A reliable and scalable messaging queue is the backbone of Ascerta's asynchronous certificate processing pipeline.\
  **Impact**: This work ensured the Ascerta service had a robust and performant foundation, capable of handling a high volume of certificate operations reliably.

- **What**: Was a core member of the team responsible for designing the next-generation Fastly Terraform Provider.\
  **Why**: A complete rewrite was necessary to leverage new frameworks and address long-standing architectural issues.\
  **Impact**: My contributions helped shape a modern and more maintainable provider architecture, which will result in a more reliable and feature-rich experience for customers managing their Fastly services with Terraform.

- **What**: Created detailed architectural diagrams to visualize and explain the upcoming Managed DNS service.\
  **Why**: The system was complex and a visual aid was needed to help stakeholders and team members understand how the different components would interact.\
  **Impact**: The diagrams became a key communication tool, clarifying complex concepts and facilitating productive discussions about the architecture, which helped align the team and accelerate the project.

- **What**: Presented the architecture and implementation of the Ascerta project to the wider team.\
  **Why**: To share knowledge, gather feedback, and ensure alignment on the technical direction of this critical new service.\
  **Impact**: The presentation helped upskill the entire team on the new architecture, fostering collaboration and ensuring a shared understanding of the project's goals and design.

- **What**: Led the engineering effort for "Ascerta", a new TLS certificate issuance and renewal service.\
  **Why**: To create a modern, scalable, and automated platform for managing TLS certificates for our customers and internal services.\
  **Impact**: Ascerta provides a robust and asynchronous pipeline for certificate management, improving the reliability and speed of issuance and renewals. This foundational service is critical for securing customer applications.

- **What**: Began the architectural redesign of a core service to create a dedicated API for managed TLS certificates.\
  **Why**: To decouple certificate management from other service logic, creating a more modular and scalable architecture.\
  **Impact**: This foundational work paved the way for "Ascerta", a new, standalone certificate issuance service, enabling greater flexibility and focus on TLS automation.

- **What**: Designed and implemented a new, automated secrets management workflow between 1Password and HashiCorp Vault.\
  **Why**: To improve security and efficiency by automating the synchronization of secrets.\
  **Impact**: This new system reduced manual toil, eliminated inconsistencies, and strengthened our security posture by ensuring secrets were managed in a consistent and automated way.

- **What**: Onboarded and mentored a new engineer joining the team.\
  **Why**: To ensure new team members feel supported and can become productive contributors as quickly as possible.\
  **Impact**: My mentorship helped the new hire to quickly integrate with the team and start contributing to key projects, strengthening the team's overall capacity.

### 2024

- **What**: Developed a bot to automatically track and report on scheduled maintenance from our partners.\
  **Why**: To provide the on-call team with proactive awareness of external maintenance events that could impact our services.\
  **Impact**: The bot significantly improved the on-call team's situational awareness, allowing them to anticipate and respond to potential issues more effectively, reducing stress and improving service reliability.

- **What**: Rewrote a legacy component responsible for managing partner zone data.\
  **Why**: The original implementation was difficult to maintain and extend.\
